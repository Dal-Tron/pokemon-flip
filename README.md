# Frontend Pairing App

This application will search for a Github profile and pit it against a Pokemon to fight, but there's still a lot of work to do to make this production-ready!

Please [duplicate](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/) this repository on Github, and [make the repository private](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-repository-visibility/). We will coordinate who to add as collaborators later.

All we want you to do at this point is get it installed and get familiar with the code. Running it in the browser and messing around is also recommended, but we aren't asking you to do any coding outside the interview!

If you have any problems at all, please reach out to your interview coordinator to pair you up with someone to fix whatever issue you might be having. We ask each other for help all the time, don't be shy if you get stuck!

## `npm install` or `yarn install`
